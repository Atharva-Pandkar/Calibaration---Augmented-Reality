# Calibaration & Augmented Reality

The goal of this project was to enhance comprehension of the implementation of augmented reality. The concept involves using a camera to recognize a familiar object (in this case, a chessboard) and utilize it to create a mapping of image coordinates to real-world coordinates. Several calibration images are taken from various angles of the chessboard, with a minimum threshold of five images, and then these images are used to calibrate the camera. After calibration, it becomes feasible to insert virtual objects into the scene, as long as the chessboard is visible, resulting in an augmented reality experience.
